## Commands

### Build

#### Basic Usage

To build a Next.js app, run `tf-next build` from the directory where your `next.config.js` or `package.json` is located.
The app is then checked out into a temporary folder and build from there.
Once the build process is finished, a new folder `.next-tf` is added to your current working directory.
The `.next-tf` folder contains a deployment package that can be used together with the [deploy command](#deploy) to deploy your application.

```plain
tf-next build
```

#### Extended Usage

The `--skipDownload` flag can be used to prevent the checkout into a temporary folder (builds in the current working directory instead):

```plain
tf-next build --skipDownload
```

#### Global Options

The following options can be passed when using the `tf-next build` command:

- `--skipDownload`

### Deploy

To publish an previously built Next.js app to the system, run `tf-next deploy` from the same directory where the build command was executed from.

#### Basic Usage

```plain
tf-next deploy --endpoint <api-endpoint>
```

#### Global Options

The following options can be passed when using the `tf-next deploy` command:

- `--endpoint`
- `--awsProfile`

### Deployment

To manage the deployments that are published to the system.

#### Basic Usage

To show the most recent (25) deployments:

```plain
tf-next deployment ls
```

To remove (delete) an existing deployment from the system:

```plain
tf-next deployment rm <deployment-id>
```

#### Extended Usage
