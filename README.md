## Architecture

The Next.js Terraform module is designed as a full stack AWS app. It relies on multiple AWS services and connects them to work as a single application:

![Architecture overview diagram](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js/blob/main/docs/assets/architecture.png?raw=true)

- **`I.` CloudFront**

  This is the main CloudFront distribution which handles all incoming traffic to the Next.js application.
  Static assets with the prefix `/_next/static/*` (e.g. JavaScript, CSS, images) are identified here and served directly from a static content S3 bucket ([`II`](#II-s3-static-content)).
  Other requests are delegated to the proxy handler Lambda@Edge function ([`III`](#III-lambda-edge-proxy)).

- **`II.` S3 bucket for static content**<a id="II-s3-static-content"></a>

  This bucket contains the pre-rendered static HTML sites from the Next.js build and the static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.).

- **`III.` Lambda@Edge proxy handler**<a id="III-lambda-edge-proxy"></a>

  The proxy handler analyzes the incoming requests and determines from which source a request should be served.
  Static generated sites are fetched from the S3 bucket ([`II`](#II-s3-static-content)) and dynamic content is served from the Next.js Lambdas ([`V`](#V-next-js-lambdas)).

- **`IV.` API Gateway**<a id="IV-api-gateway"></a>

  The [HTTP API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) distributes the incoming traffic on the existing Next.js Lambdas ([`V`](#V-next-js-lambdas)). It uses a cost efficient HTTP API for this.

- **`V.` Shared Next.js Lambda functions**<a id="V-next-js-lambdas"></a>

  These are the Next.js Lambdas which are doing the server-side rendering. They are composed, so a single lambda can serve multiple SSR-pages.

- **Terraform Next.js Image Optimization**

  The [image optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) is triggered by routes with the prefix `/_next/image/*`.
  It is a serverless task provided by our [Terraform Next.js Image Optimization module for AWS](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/milliHQ/next-js-image-optimization/aws).

- **Static Content Deployment**

  This flow is only triggered when a Terraform apply runs to update the application.
  It consists of a dedicated S3 bucket and a single Lambda function.
  The bucket is only used by Terraform to upload the static content from the `tf-next build` command as a zip archive.
  The upload then triggers the Lambda which unzips the content and deploys it to the static content S3 bucket ([`II`](#II-s3-static-content)).
  Static assets from previous deployments are then marked to be expired in a certain amount of days (default 30, configurable via `expire_static_assets` variable).
  After the successful deployment a CloudFront [invalidation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html) is created to propagate the route changes to every edge location.

- **Proxy Config Distribution**

  This is a second CloudFront distribution that serves a special JSON file that the Proxy ([`III`](#III-lambda-edge-proxy)) fetches as configuration (Contains information about routes).

- **CloudFront Invalidation Queue**

  When updating the app, not the whole CloudFront cache gets invalidated to keep response times low for your customers.
  Instead the paths that should be invalidated are calculated from the updated content.
  Depending on the size of the application the paths to invalidate could exceed the [CloudFront limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html#invalidation-specifying-objects%23InvalidationLimits) for one invalidation.
  Therefore invalidations get splitted into chunks and then queued in SQS from where they are sequentially sent to CloudFront.

## Usage

### Add to your Next.js project

First add our custom builder to your Next.js project. It uses the same builder under the hood as Vercel does:

```sh
npm i -D tf-next     # npm or
yarn add -D tf-next  # yarn
```

Then you should add a new script to your package.json (Make sure it is not named `build`):

```diff
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
+   "tf-next": "tf-next build"
  }
  ...
}
```

`tf-next build` runs in a temporary directory and puts its output in a `.next-tf` directory in the same directory where your `package.json` is.
The output in the `.next-tf` directory is all what the Terraform module needs in the next step.

### Setup the Next.js Terraform module

> **Note:** Make sure that the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables are set when running the Terraform commands. [How to create AWS Access Keys?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)

Adding Terraform to your existing Next.js installation is easy.
Simply create a new `main.tf` file in the root of your Next.js project and add the following content:

```tf
# main.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

# Main region where the resources should be created in
# (Should be close to the location of your viewers)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Provider used for creating the Lambda@Edge function which must be deployed
# to us-east-1 region (Should not be changed)
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "global_region"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module "tf_next" {
  source = "milliHQ/next-js/aws"

  providers = {
    aws.global_region = aws.global_region
  }
}

output "cloudfront_domain_name" {
  value = module.tf_next.cloudfront_domain_name
}
```

To deploy your app to AWS simply run the following commands:

```sh
npm run tf-next   # Build the Next.js app
yarn tf-next      # Same command when using yarn

# Expose your AWS Access Keys to the current terminal session
# Only needed when running Terraform commands
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

terraform init    # Only needed on the first time running Terraform

terraform plan    # (Optional) See what resources Terraform will create
terraform apply   # Deploy the Next.js app to your AWS account

> Apply complete!
>
> Outputs:
>
> cloudfront_domain_name = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net"
```

After the successful deployment your Next.js app is publicly available at the CloudFront subdomain from the `cloudfront_domain_name` output.

### Deployment with Terraform Cloud

When using this module together with [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/) make sure that you also upload the build output from the [`tf-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tf-next) task.
You can create a `.terraformignore` in the root of your project and add the following line:

```diff
# .terraformignore
+  !**/.next-tf/**
```

## Known issues

Under the hood this module uses a lot of [Vercel's](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/) build pipeline.
So issues that exist on Vercel are likely to occur on this project too.

- Stack deletion (`terraform destroy`) fails on first run ([terraform-provider-aws#1721](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/1721))

  This is intentional because we cannot delete a Lambda@Edge function (Used by proxy module) in a synchronous way.
  It can take up to an hour for AWS to unbind a Lambda@Edge function from it's CloudFront distribution even when the distribution is already destroyed.

  **Workaround:**

  After running the initial `terraform destroy` command (that failed) wait ~1 hour and run the command again.
  This time it should run successfully and delete the rest of the stack.

- Initial apply fails with error message `Error: error creating Lambda Event Source Mapping` ([#138](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js/issues/138))

  There is some race condition when the permissions are created for the static deployment Lambda.
  This should only happen on the first deployment.

  **Workaround:**

  You should be able to run`terraform apply` again and the stack creation would progreed without this error.
